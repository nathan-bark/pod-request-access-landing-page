## My process

I first started by simply laying out the structure with HTML. I did it by focussing individually on each section until finished. Then reread the code to check for errors.
After HTML, I followed a similar procedure on CSS for the styling. First I concentrated positioning of each section, then focussed on smaller details such as colours, fonts, borders etc. After completing the styling for desktop, I progressed with changes via media queries based on different break points.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript


### What I learned

This project helped to clear up the process of using Javascript events and connecting Javascript to the DOM. I also put into practice what I have learned on HTML forms.

### Continued development

I will continue developing my skill in Javascript on different platforms such as Codewars.
